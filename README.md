### For Intelligent Systems class
- DIP Activity
- DIP Convolution Matrix Prpcess

For images this can:
- Pixel Copy, Greyscale, Inversion, Mirror H/V, Sepia
- Histogram, Brightness, Contrast, Rotation, Scale to 100px/1000px, Binary Thresholding
- Equalisation

Used AForge library forr Webcam integration
For video streams filters from Filters.cs:
- Greyscale, Inversion, Flip H/V/Both
- Gamma, Brightness, Contrast, Color
- Smooth, Gaussian Blur, Mean Removal, Sharpen, Emboss Laplacian
- Edge Detect: Quick/Convoluution/Horizontal/Vertical/Homegenity/Difference
- Edge Enhance
- Random Jitter, Swirl, Sphere, Time Warp, Moire, Water, Pixelate

Added Coin Detection
- counts values of coins via thresholds
